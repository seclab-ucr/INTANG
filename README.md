Introduction
==================
INTANG is a research project for circumventing the "TCP reset attack" from the Great Firewall of China (GFW) by disrupting/desynchronizing the TCP Control Block (TCB) on the censorship devices. INTANG runs as a client-side only tool in background to protect the TCP connections from being interfered (or even monitored) by the GFW. It works on TCP/IP layers instead of application layer, thus considered more general and can help all application layer protocols to evade censorship, e.g. HTTP, DNS over TCP, OpenVPN, Tor. It can also be run on a proxy to make the deployment easier for those who are incapable of running INTANG (using OSes other than Linux or doesn't have root privillige).

Platform
==================
Linux (must has netfilter supported in kernel)

*Tested with Ubuntu 12.04/14.04/16.04. and Fedora 26*

Ubuntu Dependencies
==================
* libnetfilter-queue-dev
* libnfnetlink-dev
* redis-server
* libhiredis-dev
* libev-dev
* python-redis (optional)
* python-scapy (optional)

Fedora Dependencies
==================
* libnetfilter_queue-devel
* libnfnetlink-devel
* redis
* hiredis-devel
* libev-devel
* python-redis (optional)
* scapy (optional)

Compilation
==================
1. Install prerequisite packages on Ubuntu:
```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libnetfilter-queue-dev libnfnetlink-dev redis-server libhiredis-dev libev-dev python-redis python-scapy
```
or
```shell
./install_deps.sh
```
Install prerequisite packages on Fedora:
```shell
sudo dnf update
sudo dnf install libnetfilter_queue-devel libnfnetlink-devel redis hiredis-devel libev-devel python-redis scapy
```
2. Compile:
```shell
make
```
And the binary will be located under bin folder.

How to Run
==================
1. Use `run.sh` to start the daemon. Logs are by default written to /var/log/intangd.log. If you want to test a specific strategy, use `run.sh <strategy ID>`. Strategy IDs can be checked with `run.sh -h`.
2. Use `stop.sh` to stop the daemon. It simply send SIGINT signal to the daemon.

**The daemon needs root privilege to run.**
**If you are using Virtual Machine, you'll need to configure the networks in Bridge Mode.**

Disclaimer
==================
INTANG is a research-oriented project. Anyone using it should be aware of the potential risks and responsible for his/her own actions against the censorship authority.
